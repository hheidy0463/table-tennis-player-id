# Table Tennis Player Identification

This repository provides a pipeline to extract table tennis player names from scoreboard OCR outputs and match them against a reference list. It also includes an optional scraper to refresh the player list from the WTT website.

## Repository Structure
```
ONBOARDING_TASK/
├─ data/
│  ├─ player_list.csv           # baked list of reference player names
│  └─ samples/                  # 30 sample clips, each with `sb/sb.pkl`
├─ scripts/
│  ├─ identify_players.py       # main end-to-end driver script
│  ├─ inspect_tokens.py         
│  ├─ name_utils.py             # canonicalization & fuzzy-matching logic
│  ├─ scrape_ittf_rankings.py   # ITTF website scraper
│  └─ scrape_wtt_players.py     # WTT website scraper
├─ README.md                    
├─ requirements.txt             # Python dependencies
└─ video_player_names_matched.csv
```  

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer

## Installation
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/table-tennis-player-id.git
   cd table-tennis-player-id
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the main pipeline to produce `video_player_names_matched.csv`:
```bash
python scripts/identify_players.py --data data/samples
```
The output CSV will be written to the repo root.

## Optional: Refresh Reference List
To regenerate `data/player_list.csv` from the World Table Tennis website:
```bash
python scripts/scrape_wtt_players.py --event 3108
```  
This will fetch the player list for the specified event ID and overwrite `data/player_list.csv`.
